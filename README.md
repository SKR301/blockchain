  - **Block Page** : It shows all the blocks of the *Blockchain*.
  - **Conduct a Transaction Page** : Here you can perform transaction and can send the *currency* to other users by providing their *wallet address*.
  - **Transaction Pool Page** : It allows you to check the *pool of transactions* ready to be mined and a button to mine them.
